# Prediction of Wine Quality

This project uses the UCI Machine Learning repository dataset on wine quality in order to build a series of models which predict a wine's quality based on its physiochemical components. Data exploration, visualization, feature selection, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and multimodal model testing pipelines are all included in this work.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure python 3.X is downloaded as it will be used for all coding in this project using jupyter notebook
2. Get datasource from UCI machine learning repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
